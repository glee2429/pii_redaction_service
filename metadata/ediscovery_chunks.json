Deleted Data: Deleted Data is data that, in the past, existed on the computer as live data and\nwhich has been deleted by the computer system or end-user activity. Deleted data remains on\nstorage media in whole or in part until it is overwritten by ongoing usage or \u201cwiped\u201d with a\nsoftware program specifically designed to remove deleted data. Even after the data itself has\nbeen wiped, directory entries, pointers, or other metadata relating to the deleted data may\nremain on the computer.\nD. Document: The term \"document\" encompasses all discoverable information within the scope of\nFed. R. Civ. P. 34(a), including \"all writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound\nrecordings, images, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which\ninformation can be obtained.\" Accordingly, both paper-based documents and electronically\nstored information-including, but not limited to, emails, attachments, databases, word\ndocuments, spreadsheets and graphic files-are covered by this definition.\nSample Forms and Pleadings\nvisit www.krollontrack.com\n\u00a9 2007 Kroll Ontrack, Inc.
